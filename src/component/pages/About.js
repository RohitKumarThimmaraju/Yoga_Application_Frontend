        The literal translation of the word “yoga,” which is from Sanskrit (recognized as the original language of yoga) is “union,” says Sherwin.right up arrow And that’s an apt way to describe yoga as we know it today, she says. “We define it as bringing together the mind and the body by use of the breath.”

        Many people have come to know the physical benefits of yoga and think of it as a type of workout, says Sherwin. But yoga is way more than that. “It’s really an entire lifestyle; the postures are only one piece of it,” she says.

        Yoga began in India and has been around for about 5,000 years, says Sherwin. “Originally it was taught one-on-one and only to men of the highest caste,” she says.

        Traditionally, yoga is a system to foster well-being on the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual levels.right up arrow Yoga is now not generally thought of as a set of religious beliefs. It can be practiced in a completely secular manner, and it's practiced by people of all faith traditions, as well as people who are agnostic and atheist, according to the Yoga Alliance.right up arrow
        Yoga is thought to have first come to the United States at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th. One critical moment was when Swami Vivekananda spoke at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893. Another milestone in yoga’s spread in the West was Paramahansa Yogananda’s book, Autobiography of a Yogi, published in 1946 and still read by many yoga students, Sherwin says. In the first half of the 20th century, it was more common for yoga instructors to travel from city to city to teach a yoga class or give a yoga lecture rather than teach in a studio (as is the case today).right up arrow
        Notably, changes in U.S. immigration policy starting in 1965 allowed more South Asian immigrants to come to America (including yogis from India, where the practice was more established).right up arrow By the 1970s, yoga studios and books could be found across the United States.
